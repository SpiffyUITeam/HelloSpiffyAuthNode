MainPanel_html=<\!-- This is the template file for the main application page.  The first \r\n     step here is to add some elements with special IDs we&\#39;ll bind to later.\r\n     Each on of these elements will get a dynamic control added to it in\r\n     src/main/java/org.spiffyui.spiffyauthnode/client/Index.java.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<div id\="longMsg"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n    Enter your name\: <span id\="nameField"></span> <span id\="submitButton"></span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<div id\="spiffyIntroText">\r\n    <p>\r\n        This is a <a href\="http\://www.spiffyui.org">Spiffy UI</a> application built just for you and running on your computer.  This simple example shows you an easy form which makes a <a href\="http\://www.spiffyui.org/\#b\=rest">REST</a> call to your server. You can edit it, build it, run it, share it with your friends, and build a product on top of it.  The application is all yours.\r\n    </p>\r\n    \r\n    <h2>Next steps</h2>\r\n    \r\n    <p>\r\n        You&\#39;ve played with the project a little, now make some changes.  \r\n    </p>\r\n    \r\n    <ol>\r\n        <li>\r\n            <b>Change this page</b> - This page is a template with most of the code in HTML and the dynamic controls added later.  Changed the content in <code>src/main/java/org/spiffyui/spiffyauthnode/client/MainPanel.html</code>.\r\n        </li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n            <b>Change the style</b> - You can set any style in <code>src/main/java/org/spiffyui/spiffyauthnode/public/SpiffyAuthNode.css</code>.\r\n        </li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n            <b>Add a <a href\="http\://www.spiffyui.org/\#b\=rest">REST Bean</a></b> - Make this REST call reusable by adding it to a <a href\="http\://www.spiffyui.org/\#b\=rest">REST Bean</a>.\r\n        </li>\r\n        \r\n        <li>\r\n            <b>Add a navigation bar</b> - Easy navigation for your application is one of the great features of Spiffy UI.\r\n        </li>\r\n    </ol>\r\n    \r\n    <p>\r\n        After you make any change you can stop the server and run the <code>Ant</code> command to recompile your project.  You can also use the <a href\="http\://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> IDE to run this application in <a href\="http\://www.spiffyui.org/\#b\=hostedMode">GWT dev mode</a>.\r\n    </p>\r\n</div>\r\n
